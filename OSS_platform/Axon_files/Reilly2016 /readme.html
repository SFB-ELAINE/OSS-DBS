<h3>Usage</h3>
Auto-launch from ModelDB, or unzip the zip file.<br>
Use mknrndll (OS X or MSWin) or nrnivmodl (UNIX/Linux) to compile the mod files.<br>
Then launch mosinit.hoc ("nrngui mosinit.hoc" in unix/linux) and <br>
choose a button or individually run one of the main programs:<br>
for cases A1-12 (see Reilly 2016): nrngui initA.hoc<br>
for cases B13, 14, 16, and 17 with a 5 um diameter axon: nrngui initB5.hoc<br>
for cases B13, 14, 16, and 17 with a 10 um diameter axon: nrngui initB10.hoc<br>
Then follow the instructions that the program prints to its terminal.<p></p>
As the program runs traces of voltage are displayed on the screen.  <br>
For example the 10 um diam case ends with one of the graphs displaying: <br>

Note that the values printed on the command line correspond to the "I" traces in figures 1 and 2 in the paper. <br>
Those should match those in comments at the end of each program. <br>
<h3>Description of code</h3>
This code implements NEURON models of extracellular stimulation of the Frankenhaeuser-Huxley (F-H) model of myelinated axon (in particular, an A fiber). Parameters are from (Frankenhaeuser and Huxley 1964), (Hines and Shrager 1991), and page 3 of "Survey of nerve electrostimulation models" dated 11/29/2014 and provided by J.P. Reilly (see comments in the source code). Pertinent differences relative to McNeal model (1976): McNeal used 110 ohm cm for cytoplasmic resistivity, as did Frankenhaeuser and Huxley (1964), but this model uses 100, following Reilly and Diamant (2011).<p></p>

The extracellular stimulus is implemented directly, i.e. by controlling potential at the outer surface of each model compartment. Simulations use NEURON's built-in adaptive integrator with DASPK, a differential algebraic solver with preconditioned Krylov method (Brown et al. 1994). Absolute error tolerance is 0.001, and tolerance scale factors selected automatically by NEURON's VariableTimeStep tool are as follows:<br>
v (transmembrane potential) 100<br>
vext (extracellular potential) 10<br>
m_fh, h_fh, n_fh 0.1<br>
p_fh 0.01<p></p>

The code follows a more or less modular design and is implemented as main files that load other files.<br>
initA.hoc is the main file for cases A1-12.<br>
axon5.hoc and axon10.hoc specify properties of models with external diameter 5 and 10 um, respectively.<br>
interpxyz.hoc contains proc grindaway() which calculates the xyz coordinates of the model's internal "nodes" (compartment centers, not nodes of Ranvier).<br>
basicrig.ses, varstep.ses, vvsx.ses, and vext_eext.ses recreate GUI tools for launching simulations, specifying integration method, plotting variables of interest vs. time and distance along the axon.<br>
thresh4.hoc contains procedures for determining spike threshold to 4 significant figures. <br>
protocolsA.hoc specifies the stimulus parameters for cases A1-12.<br>
initB5.hoc and initB10.hoc are the main files for cases B15 and B18, and for B13, B14, B16, and B17, respectively.<br>
protocolsB.hoc specifies the stimulus parameters for cases B13-18.<p></p>

<h3>Major features or limitations</h3>
The threshold stimulus for eliciting a spike is determined automatically by binary search.
To insure correct spike detection, membrane potential is monitored for a positive going deflection rising above -20 mV at a location that is anatomically and electrotonically distant from the site at which the stimulus produces the maximum local depolarization (i.e. at node 0 for Case A, and node 50 for Case B). During development, after threshold was determined, spiking was confirmed by visual examination of the time course of membrane potential along the axon following application of a just suprathreshold stimulus.<p></p>

It would be nice if the model specification code were written in such a way that it would be easy to change axon external diameter after a model has been set up. Since it is not, initB5.hoc and initB10.hoc are both designed to run through cases B13, 14, 16, and 17, using models with external diameters of 5 and 10 um, respectively. This avoids the need to write special simulation code to deal with cases 15 and 18, by taking advantage of the fact that cases 15 and 18 differ from 14 and 17 only in axon diameter--5 um for the former, 10 um for the latter.<p></p>
