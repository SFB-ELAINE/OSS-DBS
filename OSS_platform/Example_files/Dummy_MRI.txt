%The file should have exactly the same structure, including comment lines (they will be automatically dropped, you can just substitute them with empty lines). First we have 3 spatial vectors to define coordinates of voxels in MRI data box.

0.0 1.0
0.0 1.0
%Now values of segmented tissues in corresponding voxels. For this example we should have 3*2*2 values (lenghts of the spatial vectors). Alternatively, you can have values in XY slices i.e different z-values are on different lines. NOTE: this whole comment is on one line.
